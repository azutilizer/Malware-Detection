# Malware-Detection

    This project is to detect and classify malware behavior using machine learning.
    I assume that there's dataset as json files in "data/json" directory. 
    You can see/change it in config.ini file. 

# Overview

###  Requirements

- Install python and docker on your machine.

```
sudo apt install python3 pythone3-venv git
sudo apt install docker-ce
```

For docker running, I wrote 'Dockerfile' and 'Makefile' so one can build and run docker easily using one command.

```
make shell
```
This command builds docker image with CUDA, CUDNN library installing and other dependencies.


### Pre-Processing and Training

```
python3 data_process.py
python3 data_encoder.py
python3 train.py
```


### Pre-trained model

There are pre-trained model in "result".

You should download one more model and put it in "result/model" directory.

#  System Inference

### Back-End Server

Copy trained model files to inference/server by running this:
```
cp -r result/temporary/dataset.csv.xz inference/server/resources/
cp -r result/temporary/top_unigrams.txt inference/server/resources/
cp -r result/model/mal-Trained-Model.pt inference/server/resources/model_data/
cp -r result/model/MLP-Trained-Model.pt inference/server/resources/model_data/
```
To run server,
> python3  run.py

### Front-End build

```
cd inference/client
npm install
npm run dev
```
