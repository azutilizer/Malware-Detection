# Malware-Detection

    This project is to detect and classify malware behavior using machine learning.
    I assume that there's dataset as json files in "data" directory. 
    You can see/change it in config.ini file. 

# Overview

###  Requirements

- Install python and docker on your machine.

```
sudo apt install python3 pythone3-venv git
sudo apt install docker-ce
```

For docker running, I wrote 'Dockerfile' and 'Makefile' so one can build and run docker easily using one command.

```
make shell
```
This command builds docker image with CUDA, CUDNN library installing and other dependencies.

After docker running, install PyTorch.

```
pip3 install torch torchvision
```


### Pre-Processing and Training

```
python3 data_process.py
python3 data_encoder.py
python3 train.py
```
